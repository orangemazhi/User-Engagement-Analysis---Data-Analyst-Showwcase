# User-Engagement-Analysis Data Analyst Showwcase
In this project, I will conduct a short user engagement analysis on the Showwcase data.

Showwcase is an online platform where members of the tech community connect, share their knowledge, work experiences, projects built, people they've worked with - and find new opportunities. Showwcase users can like,follow, comment, and share posts on the platform. The company's goal is to build a platform that encourages users to share, exchange ideas, connect, and learn from other users.

User engagement metrics are strong indicators of how relevant the siteâ€™s content is to a user. These metrics not only help Google determine the ranking but also help the companies identify what elements of their site work best.
